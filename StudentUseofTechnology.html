If there is reasonable suspicion that a pupil has violated District policy or this Agreement or if maintenance and monitoring of the district&rsquo;s computers or Internet system leads to discovery of a violation of District policy or this Agreement, the discipline guidelines, or the law, an individual search will be conducted. The investigation will be reasonable and related to the suspected violation.

These services assist students with staying organized, prevent lost homework, and allow pupils to collaborate on learning. When using these services students work in a safe environment because uninvited guests are not allowed to access assignments. In order to access the assignment, a person must be invited and added to the site as a &ldquo;shared collaborator.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The District administrator regulates pupil services depending on the guidelines in this Agreement.
